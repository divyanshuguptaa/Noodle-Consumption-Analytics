# Noodle Consumption Analytics


Focused on showcasing proficiency in data analysis through SQL, Tableau, Python, and R, this portfolio project delves into a comprehensive exploration of global instant noodle trends. The curated dataset is meticulously crafted from three distinct sources to provide valuable insights.

The primary source involves extracting data from Mr. Hans "The Ramen Rater" Lienesch's extensive instant noodle review database, boasting over 4,000 reviews. This dataset, known as "The Big List," is generously provided in XLSX and PDF formats. Rigorous cleaning and standardization were executed using Google Sheets, ensuring the inclusion of the latest reviews, their corresponding URLs, and a comprehensive record of Top Ten Lists over the years.

The World Instant Noodles Association (WINA) contributes global instant noodles demand rankings, offering a unique perspective on noodle consumption across countries.

The dataset is enriched further with insights from the United Nations Total Population Database, providing essential population estimates. Access the database and more here. This information serves as a crucial element for calculating ramen consumption per capita.

Compiling data from these three sources, along with "The Big List" raw data, the project's foundation is laid in the Excel file titled "Ramen Full List (last updated date)."

It's important to note that some disparities exist between the data provided by WINA and the dataset used in this project. Notably, values for China and Hong Kong are split, approximated based on their relative populations. The "Others" category in WINA's data is further disaggregated to estimate noodle consumption for nations not originally included in the ranking. This approximation is calculated by multiplying the consumption of "Others" by the proportion of the population of the specific nation relative to the total remaining world population.
